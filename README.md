# Diet and Water Recommendation App

This project provides a recommendation system for diet and water intake based on the user's preferences, activity level, and dietary goals. It is built with a **Flask** backend and a **Flutter** front-end.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (for large files)

### Setting up the Flask Backend

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saikrishy3808u3qr3pur3q/Diet_and_Water_Recommendation_App.git
   cd Diet_and_Water_Recommendation_App

### Install required Python packages

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
### Start the Flask server

Make sure your virtual environment is activated and then run the Flask app:

```bash
python Flask_Server/app.py
